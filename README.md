This project uses the Netflix Movies Dataset (single CSV) to demonstrate key Data Science steps: data loading, manipulation, cleaning, visualization, and feature engineering. After importing the dataset, missing values are handled, data types are corrected, and unnecessary columns are removed. Exploratory visualizations such as distributions, bar charts, and relationships between runtime, IMDb score, and year are created. Feature engineering includes Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding, creation of new derived columns, and Feature Scaling using Standardization & Min-Max Scaling, along with Polynomial Features for advanced modeling. This project helps understand a complete preprocessing workflow commonly used in Machine Learning projects.
